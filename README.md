What is the Apeiara idea?

Technological advancement has provided many benefits and perks to the
population in recent years. Some of these advances are meant for entertainment and
recreation, while others are categories that cause big impacts in the life of the user
and allow them to perform activities that previously were impossible, such as the
Assistive Technology. Despite all the social work behind the Assistive Technology, it
is still a young market, where developers fear to invest due to lack of investment by
big companies and mainly in low financial return. Projects for the Assistive
Technology tend to have a high investment cost and no financial return on this
investment, once the number of users is very limited when compared to popular
applications. Therefore, the Apeiara proposal is a social and open source project. Its goal is to support people with visual impairment in their movements, ensuring safety, both
for the user and for the caregiver, quality of life and a basic right of every citizen: the
right to come and go. 
The Apeiara project was initially designed to help visually impaired people, however, its potential is observed to be amplified and applicated for other types of impairments that need help such as Mental Disorders and ASD. Its mechanisms allow impaired people to request help or any sort of information through a smartphone application directly to a network of people connected in any part of the world who are willed to help. In the case of visually impaired people, they are able to do any kind of request using only command of voices. Once the request is sent, every single people that is connected to that person will receive the request with the description and exact location of the person requesting help.
